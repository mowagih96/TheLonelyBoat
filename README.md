 <h3>Features :</h3>
 <br />
 You can traverse through the scene by holding the mouse's right click and move either to the left or the right.
 <br />
 You can rotate the camera's view direction by holding the mouse's left click and move in 360 degree.
 <br />
 You can zoom in and out by using the mouse's scroll wheel.
 <br />
 You can access the website from anywhere with any resoultion just make sure your browser supports WebGL.
 <br />
 Natural sounds to make the scene lively.

<h3>Short description :</h3>
 <br />
 The project consists of 2 scenes (sunset and night time scenes)
 <br />
 The scene starts with a deserted boat being away pushed by the wind's and the ocean's force in addition to 3 fallen boxes off of it as the sun sets while the rain is falling non stop and a mad hurricane waiting to crush it.
 <br />
 The sunlight's intensity will start to fade away as the sun goes down after 15 seconds from the initial scene's launch.
 <br />
 Darkness covers the sky and the hurricane hits the lonely boat to toss it to the sharks while the lightning bolts covers the sky.
 <br />
 The boat has drown in the ocean but after some time it floats back to surface to continue it's journey in the fog.

 <h3>Some tricks :</h3>
 The hurricane you see isn't a fancy 3D object like cone or cylinder or whatever it's just a simple 2D plane by making it rotates 45 degrees around it's y-axis you'll get the illusion of seeing a rotating cone , pretty cool eh?
 <br />
 The rain you see isn't created by any fancy engines it's just a bunch of simple 2D points scattered at random positions in the scene.
 <br />
 The simulation of the boxes motion is pretty simple , by using the cosine wave you'll see the boxing moving upwards and downwards pretty fast as if they were trying to float like in reality.
